    <p class="transtextbox mb font1">Throughout my working career IT has played a large role in my career, on one such instance when i was a Lab Technician, 
        IT helped streamline the job from customer inquiries to knowing who had the sample and where it is was and what stage  
        well as what test the client needed doing. During my free time I dabbled with some programming tools such as unity, sql and 
        unreal engine, also gained experience with troubleshooting family IT problems.
    <br><br>
        After the company closed down its sites, I had been told by my adviser about a 3 week developer coding course done by code 
        nation as it would be of benefit to me as i had previous IT knowledge. My experience with code nation has allowed me to build 
        upon my knowledge for coding, learn more about my abilities and to see the code being used to design a text based games and o 
        build a website.
