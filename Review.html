        The tools used were applicable, visual studio code helped simplify the editing of source code and to give visual feedback on where the errors 
        are. Trello board helped to be organised also to keep track of where I was up to as well see how much i had done. Slack has helped with
        problem solving codes, sharing codes and idea also to get suggestions on simplifying the block of codes.

    <p class="transtextbox u2pht font1">
        Visual studio codes is a lightweight tool along with slack google doc  helps to streamline the process as you can switch between them and 
        experience little slow down allowing a much faster flow rate also helped by the tools being error free including sudden stops, show the 
        reliability of these tools.

        The strength of my website is the moving background, using the mp4 file format, navigation bar and the way it highlights upon the cursor 
        hover over them.I would change the way pages are loaded on to the page, I would also add some background ambiance and change the font. 
        Overall I am happy with how my website has turned out as it shows what i can do.

    <p class="transtextbox u2pht font1">
        Further improvements I would make is to add more content like the adding the python game, trello board and link to linkedin also to add 
        more flavor text  will add more to the units. I would also check the grammar of the website as well  as to further add more to each paragraph.

        Reviewing the outcome i came across the W3C standards, it enables developers build rich interactive experiences as well as allow the 
        website to work in multiple web browsers, this helped to make sure the websites meets the HTML standard requirement.

        IT tools and systems used can be both helpful in productivity and efficiency, emailing for example can be sent quickly but cant be 
        used to convey emotions, social networks and send work, images and good for discussing but can get distracted as well as overwhelmed. 
        Making the website could be done as a them, as one person would be responsible for web design another for content.

    <p class="transtextbox u2pht font1">
        There are a lot of ways to increase productivity and efficiency, a few, would be to make sure to keep track of how much time is 
        spent on each task, taking regular breaks, solve one problem at a time and communicate effectively.

        I would do more group chats and to make use of file sharing tools to help improve productivity in future projects, using tools like
         station to help organize workstation and to seamlessly switch between apps as well as make use of GitHub as well to consolidate all 
         the versions of the project and to know the changes made to each version

        To test digital solution I would use SQA helps to develop the software process including preventing errors and bugs in the product, 
        SQC controls the certification of software products quality before release, this process is governed by software quality assurance as 
        well as the use of black box testing  and end-user tesint or user-acceptance testing.
