    <p class="transtextbox u2pht font1">For home page I went the simple route to just show the about me and navigation bar, 
        pages 2 and 3 I went with a list with the question and answer format, followed by the next page for the reviews and the 
        final page being for the references only. I used a combonation of two types of fonts one is bangers and the other is 
        girassol also used the white colour for the font for better readability.
