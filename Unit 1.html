    <p class="transtextbox u2pht font1">Business without a good IT infrastructure would struggle to become successful, as IT helps to streamline the day to day of the 
       business such as storing, tracking, planning and storing information as this helps to not to be reliant on a single person 
       another benefit is getting their business known to a wider audience as to increase their clients and to provide better services

    <h2 class="transtextbox h u2hdwth font2">What do you need to make projects successful?</h2>
</div>

<div>
    <p class="transtextbox u2pht font1">To make projects successful the use of tools such as trello, slack and google docs, helps the team to collaborate better in the 
       workplace and outside as well as help large groups to come to getter this helps to keep everyone on the right page along with 
       working towards deadlines. Some skills needed for a successful project are critical thinking, communication, task management.

</div>

<div>   
    <div class="transtextbox u2pht font1">I will use the trello board to plan out the website as trello has three categories; 
       doing, done and to do which helps to know the progress of the website is at and what is left to be done.<br>

    <h2 class="transtextbox h u2hdwth font2">Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h2>
</div>

<div>
    <p class="transtextbox u2pht font1">There are a number of reasons to account for a project failing one possibility is the poor communication is yet 
        another common reason for IT project failure, this problem can also be linked to the lack of project management and
        also the project schedule, where the project should be completed by a certain time frame for the client but meet
        random deadlines an overly optimistic schedule is followed by immense pressure on the team and is loathed by the
        team members.[1]
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2 class="transtextbox h u2hdwth font2">Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software?</h2>
</div>

<div>
    <p class="transtextbox u2pht font1">Selecting the right kind of technology or software is knowing what you're looking for, or you need it to do, 
        whether it's to fill multiple roles or a single role, also what the budget allocated for the technology or 
        software is. Listing the relevant IT system or software package will help to  see how much the changes will cost 
        and whether the changes are within a set budget and what changes are given priority.

<div>
    <h2 class="transtextbox h u2hdwth font2">Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. </h2>
</div>

<div>
    <p class="transtextbox u2pht font1">Trello is also another useful tool as it has helped to keep projects organized, know who is working on something, 
        as well as how much has been done. Github has helped with bug tracking, task management and to keep track of the 
        changes made by the team.

    <h2 class="transtextbox h u2hdwth font2">Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h2>

<div>

        agreed to be contracted to be target like clicking an opt-in button or link online, as well as using cookies have to be 
        made clear to people visiting  the site and obtain their consent as well how it's being used. Not complying with GDPR can
